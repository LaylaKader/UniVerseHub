## Overview
The Community-based Educational Study Platform addresses key challenges in modern university education in Bangladesh. Many students face difficulties in finding study groups, accessing quality educational materials, and understanding complex subjects. Existing systems often lack comprehensive features and personalized support. Our platform aims to provide a centralized hub for diverse learning resources, facilitate collaborative study sessions, and offer tailored counseling services. Ultimately, we seek to empower students by enhancing their educational experience, promoting teamwork, and preparing them for future challenges.
